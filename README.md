# CalvertSandyBeachMicrobiomes
Data from Okamoto et al. 2022

Metabarcode sequences from intertidal transects of sandy beaches from Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada.
Bacteria and Archaea were assessed using the V4 region of the 16S (small subunit) rRNA gene.
Eukaryotes, primarily protists but also meiofauna, were assessed using the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S (small subunit) rRNA gene.

Please see our paper for methodological details.
