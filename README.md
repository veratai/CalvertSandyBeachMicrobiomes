# Calvert Sandy Beach Microbiomes
Data from Okamoto et al. 2022

Metabarcode sequences from intertidal transects of sandy beaches from Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada.
Bacteria and Archaea were assessed using the V4 region of the 16S (small subunit) rRNA gene.
Eukaryotes, primarily protists but also meiofauna, were assessed using the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S (small subunit) rRNA gene.

18S V4 sequences from June 2014:
201406.rep_set_mc2_min5b_noOBAA.fna

18S V4 sequences from June 2015 to January 2016
WestBeachSand_18SV4_rep_seqs97_min5.fasta

18S V9 sequences:
rep_set_min5b_pr2gg97tax_noBacArc.fna

Additional sequences from West Beach, Calvert Island, but not published:

The raw 16S-V4 and 18S-V9 sequence data have also been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) under project accession no. PRJEB14727 with the 16S-V4 data depos- ited under run accession nos. ERR1519910 to ERR1520023 and 18S-V9 data deposited under run accession nos. ERR1520036 to ERR1520147. These data are also available in QIITA (qiita.ucsd.edu) under study no. 10145 as part of the Earth Microbiome Project. The 18S-V4 sequence data have been deposited in the ENA under project accession nos. PRJEB24000 (for samples collected in June 2014) and PRJEB40353 (June 2015 to January 2016).
